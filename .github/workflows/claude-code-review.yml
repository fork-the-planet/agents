            Review this PR. Read AGENTS.md for project conventions and architecture patterns.

            Focus on substantive issues only:
            - Bugs, logic errors, or race conditions
            - Security concerns (hardcoded secrets, injection, unsafe input)
            - Architecture misalignment with project conventions
            - Missing or inadequate test coverage for new behavior
            - Public API changes that need a changeset

            Use inline comments (`mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment`) for code-specific feedback on particular lines.
            Use `gh pr comment` for a brief top-level summary.

            BE CONCISE. Skip generic praise, obvious observations, and nitpicks.
            If the PR looks good, just say so in one sentence.
